Web app that makes writing and subscribing to email series easy

## Description
Overall, this is a web application that will be like Medium for writing and subscribing to email series.

For writers, writing up a new email series, day after day, week after week can be a lot. In this application, email series will be a set number of entries that readers can subscribe to at any time and receive the series in order from the day they subscribe. Writers can write say 10 entries that a reader will receive weekly for 10 weeks. No need for a writer to write additional entries in real time!

Your email series could be about anything - from your top 10 underrated NBA players to your favorite recipes to yoga tips. They could be fun, informational, for business, etc.

## Back End
This application will have a REST API with a spring boot framework, deployed in EC2 or Docker containers in ECS (more to come)

## Front End
The front end will have a react framework (still looking into an AWS service to act as a front end server)
